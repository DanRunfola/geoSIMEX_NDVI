\section{Methods and Data}
\subsection{Methods}
Two different approaches are followed. 
First, we use a monte carlo simulation procedure to examine the relative accuracy of geoSIMEX as contrasted to other procedures.  
Second, we apply geoSIMEX to a case study of the impact of Chinese Aid on environmental outcomes in Africa to provide an illustrative example of when the geoSIMEX approach might lead a researcher to a different conclusion than traditional approaches.

\subsubsection{geoSIMEX}
In this section, we detail the geoSIMEX approach using an illustrative example, in which we solve the following simplified equation:
\begin{equation}
NDVI = \theta * \text{Chinese aid} + \epsilon
\label{eqn:ndvi_aid}
\end{equation}
in which Chinese aid is measured with spatial imprecision (due to, for example, limited documentation). 
Through using geoSIMEX we account for this spatial imprecision to accurately estimate the model coefficient $\theta$. 
\par
In figure \ref{fig:nepal_ex}, we present a hypothetical country with sixteen districts for which we seek to solve equation \ref{eqn:ndvi_aid}. 
Four of these sixteen units of analysis, districts 5,6,7, and 8 are distinguished on the map. 
Within this study area, a hypothetical data set contains three geocoded Chinese aid project locations of various levels of spatial precision, projects A, B, and C. 
Project A is assigned a coordinate pair in District 5 and had strong documentation, resulting
in precise geographic information (i.e. an exact latitude and longitude). 
Due to weaker project documentation, location B has a precision level indicating that it was allocated anywhere in the region that includes districts 5,6,7, and 8. 
Project C has very uncertain spatial information, such that it may be anywhere in the country. 
The area (in square kilometers) of the unit of analysis in which each project location may have been allocated gives us the size of the project locationâ€™s area of coverage, which is summarized in table \ref{precision_example}.
Using the spatial overlap between each region of interest (the sixteen districts) and the area an aid project might exist in, we calculate a probability that each district contains a given project\footnote{Here, probabilities are only based on geographic overlap, as opposed to integrating other factors which might mediate where aid is allocated. This equation can be modified to incorporate more information on spatial location, thus allowing a researcher to trade off additional assumptions or information about factors that mediate spatial allocation in exchange for higher degrees of spatial precision (i.e., through dasymetric mapping approaches).}:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:overlaps}
V_{t} = \sum_{S}^{s=1}U_{s}\left ( \frac{a_{st}}{\sum_{T}^{t=1}a_{st}} \right )
\end{equation}
\noindent 
These probabilities are used in the below steps of the geoSIMEX procedure to estimate model parameters while accounting for spatial imprecision.
\par
\textbf{The first step} of geoSIMEX is to calculate the initial level of spatial imprecision in a given dataset, defined by $\lambda$.
To reflect imprecision across a given set of aid projects and a set of units of analysis (i.e., districts), we calculate (\begin{math}\lambda\end{math}) following:

\begin{equation}\label{lambda}
\lambda = \frac{\sum_{i}^{P}Area \ of \ Coverage_i}{\sum_{i}^{P}Total \ Possible \ Area \ of \ Coverage_i}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $i$ is an individual project out of $P$ total Chinese Aid projects. 
$Area \ of \ Coverage_i$ is project $i$'s known area of coverage defined by the available documentation - i.e., the geographic area across which a project could be located. 
$Total \ Possible \ Area \ of \ Coverage_i$ is the area of coverage of project $i$ under complete spatial imprecision - e.g., the geographic area of the study area.
\par
If the latitude and longitude of every aid project was known, $\lambda$ would resolve to 0---indicating zero spatial imprecision. 
If spatial data was only available for the entire study area (e.g., aid provided for general budget support without indication of where the project was allocated), $\lambda$ would resolve to 1---indicating 100\% spatial uncertainty. 
In practice, combinations of different levels of precision in the documentation of individual aid projects result in $lambda$ values between these two extremes, resulting in a measurement of spatial imprecision between 0 and 1.
\par
\textbf{The second step} involves estimating a naive model (which can be of variable functional forms; for illustration we use ordinary least squares regression) using the source data.
For each unit of observation (i.e., district), the total dollars of aid is estimated by calculating the spatial overlap between the possible region aid could be in and the unit of observation (i.e., see table \ref{precision_example}).
In figure \ref{fig:steps}, we provide an example of the geoSIMEX procedure is applied to a dataset with an initial $\lambda$ value of 0.4.
In this figure, the x-axis represents the $\lambda$ value (spatial imprecision) for a dataset, with higher values indicating more imprecision.
The y-axis represents the estimated value of $\theta$ in equation \ref{wealth_aid}.
In \ref{fig:steps}a, the orange line represents the 95\% confidence interval of the coefficient on aid in the naive model fit in step 2. 
The horizontal black line represents the true model coefficient generated for this example ($\theta$ = 1), which the naive model fails to capture.
\par 
In \textbf{the third step}, additional imprecision is simulated by randomly decreasing the precision of observations (in this case, Chinese Aid projects), and re-calculating the total dollars of aid for each unit of observation according to the updated areas-of-overlap between each unit and aid project (see table \ref{precision_example}). 
For example, a project that has a measurement with an exact latitude and longitude will randomly be assigned a lower level of precision - i.e., a county, state, or even the entire country. 
Using these new, reduced levels of precision a model is fit in an identical fashion to step 1, and the estimated $\theta$ parameter, standard errors of the model,and $\lambda$ value for a given permutation are saved.
In figure \ref{fig:steps}b, the black points represent individual iterations, with the saved model coefficients (y axis) and their associated $\lambda$ (x axis) values. 
\par
\textbf{The fourth step} subdivides this set of iterations into three equally-sized bins based on the level of spatial uncertainty ($\lambda$) of the aid variable (e.g., if $\lambda$ values range from 0.4 to 1, coefficients are separated into bins of 0.4-0.6, 0.6-0.8, and 0.8-1). 
Average coefficient and $\lambda$ values are calculated within each bin, represented as red dots in figure \ref{fig:steps}c. 
A quadratic trend is fit on the resulting average coefficient and lambda values. 
The trend is then extrapolated back to $\lambda=0$, thus providing an estimate of $\theta$ with perfect spatial precision. 
In figure \ref{fig:steps}d, the red line represents the extrapolated trend, and the blue dot represents the extrapolated estimate of the coefficient on aid. 
\par 

\textbf{In the fifth step}, the variance and standard errors of these estimates are calculated. 
We employ a bootstrapping method to calculate the component of the standard error resulting from spatial imprecision. Here, a point from each bin is sampled, a quadratic trend is fit on the resulting values, and the trend is extrapolated back to $\lambda$ = 0. 
This process is repeated iteratively to capture as many permutations as is computationally feasible (with the number of iterations defined as $R$). 
In figure \ref{fig:steps}e, each blue line represents one extrapolated trend and $\lambda$ = 0 estimate. 
Following the approach outlined in \cite{burnham_information_2002}, we explicitly quantify both the original standard errors and the additional error from spatial imprecision:

\begin{equation}\label{variance}
var(\hat{\bar{\theta}}) = \sum_i^R \frac{1}{R} \{ var(\hat{\theta_i}) + (\hat{\theta_i}-\hat{\bar{\theta_i}})^2 \}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $R$ is the number of extrapolated coefficients (in this example, 1000). 
$var(\hat{\theta_i})$ is the standard error of each extrapolated coefficient, calculated by fitting a quadratic trend on the standard error estimates from each bin, extrapolating back to $\lambda=0$, and collecting the resulting standard error value. 
$(\hat{\theta_i}-\hat{\bar{\theta_i}})^2$ captures the remaining variance attributable to spatial uncertainty, based on the range of possible $\theta$ outcmes found in the extrapolation procedure (step 4).  

\subsubsection{Simulations}

We employ a monte carlo simulation procedure to examine the accuracy of geoSIMEX compared to other approaches to handle spatial imprecision. 
Each simulation follows 7 steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\item One of three hypothetical countries with different administrative heirarchices is generated: (1) a country with 60 subcounties, 30 counties, 10 districts, and 2 regions, (2) a country with 120 subcounties, 40 counties, 20 districts, and 5 regions, or (3) a country with 120 subcounties, 60 counties, 30 districts, and 10 regions. Each subcounty is randomly assigned a spatial area and a probability of recieving aid. 
\item 50 to 250 aid projects are randomly allocated to subcounties, according to the assigned probability of a subcounty receiving aid. 
\item A simulated measurement of NDVI is generating according to equation \ref{eqn:ndvi_aid} (defined as the number of aid projects plus random error).
\item Each aid project is given a code indicating the spatial precision that a researcher might see. Codes range from indicating the project fell within a sub-county (no spatial imprecision), to falling somewhere within a county, district, region, or the country. 
\item The expected value of aid is calculated for each subcounty. For projects with spatial imprecission, aid is disbursed to subcounties based on spatial area, with larger subcounties having a larger probability of receiving aid.\footnote{For example, consider a project where \$1 million was disbursed to either subcounty A (spatial area of 400km) or subcounty B (spatial area 100km). Because subcounty A is four times as large as subcounty B, subcounty A will be assigned four times as much aid from the project as subcounty B. Specifically, subcounty A will be assigned \$800,000 and subcounty B will be assigned \$200,000. Disbursing aid using spatial area assumes that each location (e.g., each sq. kilometer) within a country has an equal chance of receiving aid; this assumption could be modified according to dasymetric mapping approaches if desired by the researcher.}
\item Equation \ref{eqn:ndvi_aid} is estimated using  models that do not incorporate spatial imprecision: the first uses the expected value of aid, and the second only includes aid projects with complete spatial preceision (dropping out other information).
\item Equation \ref{eqn:ndvi_aid} is estimated using models that seek to incorporate spatial imprecision: geoSIMEX and a model averaging approach. In the model averaging approach, subcounties are assigned a probability of receiving aid according to their spatial size, and the expected value of aid is calculated iteratively according to that probability.  500 models are estimated, where the average coefficient is used with the standard error estimated using equation \ref{variance}. This approach is contrasted to the geoSIMEX approach.
\end{enumerate}

This process is repeated 100,000 times. 

\subsubsection{Chinese Aid in Africa}
In an illustrative case study of geoSIMEX, we examine the causal impact that Chinese aid distributed from 2005 to 2010 had on vegetation (measured using NDVI) in southeast asia.  
This study leverages a novel dataset on the location of Chinese international aid in Africa available at varying levels of precision (i.e., the exact location of each aid project is not always known).  
It integrates this information with a variety of other ancillary datasets, including the NASA Long Term Data Record (LTDR) to examine the causal impact of Chinese aid on vegetation.  
Employing geoSIMEX, we use this case study to illustrate the importance of incorporating information on spatial imprecision into analyses.
A difference-in-difference modeling strategy is followed, in which the average of NDVI before aid was allocated (pre-2004) is contrasted to the average of NDVI after aid was allocated (post-2011) for each of 351 districts:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:caseStudy}
Y_{i} = \beta_0 + \theta * Aid_{i} + \sum_{k=1}^{n}(\beta_{k} * X_{i})
\end{equation}
Where $Y_{i}$ is the difference in the average forest loss post-2011 and pre-2004 in district $i$; $Aid_{i}$ is the number of aid projects in each district; $X_{i}$ is a vector of control variables; $\beta_{k}$ is a vector of parameters for each beta covariate, and $\theta$ is the estimated impact of aid.
We calculate the initial lambda value for our dataset following \ref{lambda}, and simulate additional spatial imprecision by allocating aid to increasingly coarse units of administration.  
We repeat this analysis using three alternative modeling approaches to contrast their outcomes to geoSIMEX: (1) an ordinary least squares model in which imprecision is ignored (representative of a traditional case of the ecological fallacy), (2) a linear model in which all coarse-resolution data is removed from the dataset, and (3) a Monte Carlo model averaging approach in which hundreds of equally-probable worlds are generated based on the initial dataset, and the average beta coefficient and standard errors are reported.\footnote{It should be noted there are many approaches to model averaging, including AIC weighting, that are not tested in this paper. It is possible some of these alternative approaches may outperform the Monte Carlo procedure presented here.}



\subsection{Data}

In this analysis, we examine the impact of Chinese aid in southeast asia, explicitly focusing on second-level administrative units within Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietman.
To conduct this analysis, we leverage a dataset on the location of Chinese aid is derived through a methodology designed to Track Underreported Financial Flows (TUFF; \cite{strange_tracking_2015}).
Covariate data is collected from a variety of sources, summarized in table \ref{data_source_table}.
Our outcome measure - fluctuation in NDVI - is derived from the NASA Long Term Data Record (LTDR) dataset.
While relatively coarse resolution, this dataset represents the longest consistent record of NDVI available at the global scale.
To facilitate our difference-in-difference modeling efforts, we further select a number of covariates we believe could also impact shifts in NDVI (other than Chinese aid).
These include:
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Long-term climate data from the University of Delaware, providing precipitation and temperature data at a monthly time-step for the full data record, which is permuted to produce yearly mean, minimum, and maximum values for each project location.}
\item{Population Data is retrieved from CIESIN at Columbia University, specifically leveraging the Gridded Population of the World (GPW) data record.}
\item{Slope and Elevation data are derived from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM).}
\item{Distance to rivers is calculated based on the USGS Hydrosheds database.}
\item{Distance to roads is calculated based on the Global Roads Open Access Dataset (gRoads), which represents roads circa 2010, though the actual date of datasets is highly variable by country.}
\item{Urban travel time, calculated by the European Commission Joint Research Centre.}
\item{Nighttime Lights are retrieved from the NOAA Earth Observation Group, calculated from the Department of Defense Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP).  Lights values are temporally intercalibrated following the procedure outlined in \cite{weng_global_2014}}
\end{enumerate}
Each of these datasets are processed and aggregated according to their average values within each district included in this analysis.  
Further, the size of districts are controlled for to mitigate the challenge of variably-sized districts across the study area.
In cases where covariates were measured at a resolution coarser than the unit of observation, the relative area of overlap was used to generate a weighted mean.
Further information on this decision can be found in the discussion.
