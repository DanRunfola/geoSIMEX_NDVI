This paper investigates multicollinearity issues surrounding the local {GWR} coefficients at a single location and the overall correlation between {GWR} coefficients associated with two different exogenous variables. Results indicate that the local regression coefficients are potentially collinear even if the underlying exogenous variables in the data generating process are uncorrelated. Based on these findings, applied {GWR} research should practice caution in substantively interpreting the spatial patterns of local {GWR} coefficients. An empirical disease-mapping example is used to motivate the {GWR} multicollinearity problem. Controlled experiments are performed to systematically explore coefficient dependency issues in {GWR}. These experiments specify global models that use eigenvectors from a spatial link matrix as exogenous variables.},

	abstract = {In this paper we study the problems of estimating heterogeneity in causal effects in experimental or observational studies and conducting inference about the magnitude of the differences in treatment effects across subsets of the population. In applications, our method provides a data-driven approach to determine which subpopulations have large or small treatment effects and to test hypotheses about the differences in these effects. For experiments, our method allows researchers to identify heterogeneity in treatment effects that was not specified in a pre-analysis plan, without concern about invalidating inference due to multiple testing. In most of the literature on supervised machine learning (e.g. regression trees, random forests, {LASSO}, etc.), the goal is to build a model of the relationship between a unit's attributes and an observed outcome. A prominent role in these methods is played by cross-validation which compares predictions to actual outcomes in test samples, in order to select the level of complexity of the model that provides the best predictive power. Our method is closely related, but it differs in that it is tailored for predicting causal effects of a treatment rather than a unit's outcome. The challenge is that the "ground truth" for a causal effect is not observed for any individual unit: we observe the unit with the treatment, or without the treatment, but not both at the same time. Thus, it is not obvious how to use cross-validation to determine whether a causal effect has been accurately predicted. We propose several novel cross-validation criteria for this problem and demonstrate through simulations the conditions under which they perform better than standard methods for the problem of causal effects. We then apply the method to a large-scale field experiment re-ranking results on a search engine.},

The primary contributions of this action research are in the development of the propositions and in their implementation using a stochastic approach (Monte Carlo simulation).

In most empirical research the focus has usually been on the role of small urban centers in rural development. However, the effects of different particulars of the linkage such as spatial proximity to small towns on income of the hinterlands’ people have been less explored. The central purpose of this paper is, hence, assessing the effect of spatial proximity to small towns on income of the people living in the surrounding rural hinterlands. It also provides a bird’s-eye view of the livelihood strategies used by rural households in using town services. A propensity score matching technique is employed to estimate the effects. It is apparent in the results of the study that, controlling for other confounding factors, spatial proximity to small towns has a significantly positive effect on the income of the people living in the surrounding hinterlands. This notion indirectly leads the households living in the farthest hinterlands to adopt a new coping mechanism, i.e. enhancing their social proximity in a way that compensates the opportunity lost as a result of physical distance.},

	abstract = {International conservation donors have spent at least \$3.4 billion to protect biodiversity and stem tropical deforestation in Africa since the early 1990s. Despite more than two decades of experience, however, there is little research on the effect of this aid at a region-wide scale. Numerous case studies exist, but show mixed results. Existing research is usually based on community perception or focused on short-term donor objectives rather than specific conservation outcomes, like deforestation rates. Thus, the impact of billions of dollars of conservation aid on deforestation rates remains an open question. This article uses an original dataset to analyze the effect of international conservation aid on deforestation rates in 42 African countries between 2000 and 2013. We first describe patterns of conservation aid across the continent and then assess its impact (with one to five-year lags), controlling for other factors that may also affect deforestation, including rural population, protected areas ({PAs}), governance, and other economic and commodity production variables. We find that conservation aid is associated with higher rates of forest loss after one- or two-year lags. A similar result holds for {PA} extent, suggesting possible displacement of deforestation from {PAs}. However, governance quality in high forest cover countries moderates these effects such that deforestation rates are reduced. Rural population is the most consistent factor associated with forest loss, confirming previous studies of this driver. Our results suggest that in heavily forested countries, development projects designed to support conservation work initially in conditions of good governance, but that conservation aid alone is insufficient to mitigate larger deforestation drivers.},

In an effort to ensure the long-term viability of forest resources, restrictions are typically placed on the size of harvest areas, green-up intervals and proximity between disturbed areas in the United States. In order to satisfy consumer demands and maintain spatial and temporal restrictions, forest planners rely widely on optimization models to develop harvest schedules. A problematic element of work to date, however, is that spatial information relied upon in such analysis is typically uncertain in many ways, particularly spatial location and harvest unit boundaries. This paper develops new optimization models that explicitly account for spatial uncertainty in harvest scheduling. Application results demonstrate the effectiveness of this new perspective, enabling potential spatial uncertainty impacts to be better understood in management planning.},

Any geostatistical prediction is built on a prior model of spatial correlation that ties data to unsampled values and, equally importantly, unsampled values at different locations together.

Here we present a “benchmark” map of biomass carbon stocks over 2.5 billion ha of forests on three continents, encompassing all tropical forests, for the early 2000s, which will be invaluable for {REDD} assessments at both project and national scales. We mapped the total carbon stock in live biomass (above- and belowground), using a combination of data from 4,079 in situ inventory plots and satellite light detection and ranging (Lidar) samples of forest structure to estimate carbon storage, plus optical and microwave imagery (1-km resolution) to extrapolate over the landscape. The total biomass carbon stock of forests in the study region is estimated to be 247 Gt C, with 193 Gt C stored aboveground and 54 Gt C stored belowground in roots. Forests in Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa, and Southeast Asia accounted for 49\%, 25\%, and 26\% of the total stock, respectively. By analyzing the errors propagated through the estimation process, uncertainty at the pixel level (100 ha) ranged from ±6\% to ±53\%, but was constrained at the typical project (10,000 ha) and national ({\textgreater}1,000,000 ha) scales at ca. ±5\% and ca. ±1\%, respectively. The benchmark map illustrates regional patterns and provides methodologically comparable estimates of carbon stocks for 75 developing countries where previous assessments were either poor or incomplete.},

Such programs are designed to improve the ability of landholders to legally exclude competing users and thereby strengthen incentives to manage forests for long-term benefits. Despite the prevalence of this hypothesis, findings about the impacts of land titling programs on deforestation are mixed. Evidence is often unreliable because programs are targeted according to factors that independently influence the conversion of forests. We evaluate a donor-funded land titling and land management program for indigenous communities implemented in Morona-Santiago, Ecuador. This program offers a close to best case scenario for a land titling program to reduce deforestation because of colonization pressure, availability of payments when titled communities maintain forests, and limited opportunities for commercial agriculture. We match plots in program areas with similar plots outside program areas on covariates that influence the conversion of forests. Based on matched comparisons, we do not find evidence that land titling or community management plans reduced forest loss in the five years following legal recognition. The results call into question land titling as a direct deforestation strategy and suggests land titling is better viewed a precursor to other programs.},

That is, the data in most large data sets are not based on the results of carefully conducted randomized clinical trials, but rather represent data collected through the observation of systems as they operate in normal practice without any interventions implemented by randomized assignment rules. Such data are relatively inexpensive to obtain, however, and often do represent the spectrum of medical practice better than the settings of randomized experiments. Consequently, it is sensible to try to estimate the effects of treatments from such large data sets, even if only to help design a new randomized experiment or shed light on the generalizability of results from existing randomized experiments. However, standard methods of analysis using available statistical software (such as linear or logistic regression) can be deceptive for these objectives because they provide no warnings about their propriety. Propensity score methods are more reliable tools for addressing such objectives because the assumptions needed to make their answers appropriate are more assessable and transparent to the investigator.},

	abstract = {This article seeks to explain why the World Bank's environmental performance is so uneven despite numerous reform efforts. I argue that a principal-agent model offers a potentially powerful tool for analyzing gaps between the mandates and performance of international organizations ({IOs}) such as the World Bank. The model is particularly useful when it is calibrated to recognize problems of antinomic delegation and the dual role an {IO} may have as both agent and principal. Antinomic delegation occurs when states ask {IOs} to take on complex tasks that are difficult to institutionalize. Recognizing that many {IOs} may be principal and agent at different stages of the policy process reveals more opportunities for agency slack that are not well addressed by the {IO} literature. This article presents these modifications to the principal-agent model and applies the model to the case of the World Bank. The case study demonstrates that the nature of the tasks being delegated and the incentives shaping both sides of the principal-agent relationship are key sources of disconnect between the institution's stated goals and its performance.},

We propose an agency theory of {IOs} that can fill these gaps while also addressing two persistent problems in the study of {IOs}: common agency and long delegation chains. Our model explains slippage between member states' interests and {IO} behavior, but also suggests institutional mechanisms-staff selection, monitoring, procedural checks, and contracts-through which states can rein in errant {IOs}. We evaluate this argument by examining multiple institutional reforms and lending patterns at the World Bank from 1980 to 2000.},

	abstract = {Cities and towns are the original producers of many of the global environmental problems related to waste disposal, and air and water pollution. There is a rapidly growing need for technologies that will enable monitoring of the world’s natural resources and urban assets, and managing exposure to natural and man-made risks. The Group on Earth Observation ({GEO}) calls for strengthening the cooperation and coordination among global observing systems and research programs. Global Urban Monitoring and Assessment through Earth Observation introduces this important international collaborative effort, reviews the current state of global urban remote sensing, and expands on future directions in the field. The book reviews the current state of global urban monitoring, assessment, modeling, and prediction through Earth observation and related technologies. It then introduces {GEO}’s important international collaborative effort—Global Urban Observation and Information Task—and the current state of global urban remote sensing and future directions. It explores groundbreaking work in urban remote sensing and examines how it could contribute to the development of innovative concepts and techniques for sustainable urban development.  Despite significant progress in recent years, there remain substantial gaps in ongoing national, regional, and global efforts to address environmental challenges. Edited by a well-known expert in the field of remote sensing, {GIS}, and other geospatial technologies, this book addresses the gaps in an effective and long-term manner, highlighting the importance of increased coordination and networking among major stakeholders and of working together with other key international mechanisms. Drawing on the expertise of pioneers in the field from across the globe, the book details emerging research in the theory, methods, and techniques of urban remote sensing that provide insight into how to solve the major issues of sustainable development—one of the most important issues facing society in the future.},

	doi = {10.1073/pnas.0800437105},
	abstract = {Global efforts to reduce tropical deforestation rely heavily on the establishment of protected areas. Measuring the effectiveness of these areas is difficult because the amount of deforestation that would have occurred in the absence of legal protection cannot be directly observed. Conventional methods of evaluating the effectiveness of protected areas can be biased because protection is not randomly assigned and because protection can induce deforestation spillovers (displacement) to neighboring forests. We demonstrate that estimates of effectiveness can be substantially improved by controlling for biases along dimensions that are observable, measuring spatial spillovers, and testing the sensitivity of estimates to potential hidden biases. We apply matching methods to evaluate the impact on deforestation of Costa Rica's renowned protected-area system between 1960 and 1997. We find that protection reduced deforestation: approximately 10\% of the protected forests would have been deforested had they not been protected. Conventional approaches to evaluating conservation impact, which fail to control for observable covariates correlated with both protection and deforestation, substantially overestimate avoided deforestation (by over 65\%, based on our estimates). We also find that deforestation spillovers from protected to unprotected forests are negligible. Our conclusions are robust to potential hidden bias, as well as to changes in modeling assumptions. Our results show that, with appropriate empirical methods, conservation scientists and policy makers can better understand the relationships between human and natural systems and can use this to guide their attempts to protect critical ecosystem services.},

We utilize that data to provide a brief overview of important trends in foreign aid. Contributors to this special issue draw on {AidData} as well as other sources to analyze aid transparency, “new” donors (not previously described or analyzed), aid allocation, and aid effectiveness. Our recurring theme in this introductory essay is that {AidData} and these initial academic projects refine rather than revolutionize our understanding of aid. The database has added significant numbers of new projects, dollar amounts, donors, and details about those projects, though there is much more yet to add. We worry that aid debates have been driven by too little information, and that many claims are based on limited or very poor evidence. Rectifying these problems will not be instantaneous: refining knowledge takes a lot of time and hard work. The common feature of the papers in this special issue is their careful attention to nuance and detail. In spite of what some recent authors have claimed, aid is neither a simple solution nor a sufficient cause of most problems in developing countries; its motivations, distribution, and effects are complex, and shifting. Capturing this complexity requires detailed data, careful thought, and sophisticated methods that allow scholars to make conditional causal and descriptive inferences.},

Recent developments in this field focus on the design of allocation plans using optimization techniques. In this paper we analyze how uncertainty in spatial (input) data propagates through, and affects the results of, an optimization model. The optimization model calculates the optimal location for a ski run based on a slope map, which is derived from a digital elevation model ({DEM}). The uncertainty propagation is a generic method following a Monte Carlo approach, whereby realizations of the spatially correlated {DEM} error are generated using ‘sequential Gaussian simulation’. We successfully applied the methodology to a case study in the Austrian Alps, showing the influence of spatial uncertainty on the optimal location of a ski run and the associated development costs. We also discuss the feasibility of routine incorporation of uncertainty propagation methodologies in an {SDSS}.},

	shorttitle = {Effectiveness of Strict vs. Multiple Use Protected Areas in Reducing Tropical Forest Fires},
	abstract = {Protected areas ({PAs}) cover a quarter of the tropical forest estate. Yet there is debate over the effectiveness of {PAs} in reducing deforestation, especially when local people have rights to use the forest. A key analytic problem is the likely placement of {PAs} on marginal lands with low pressure for deforestation, biasing comparisons between protected and unprotected areas. Using matching techniques to control for this bias, this paper analyzes the global tropical forest biome using forest fires as a high resolution proxy for deforestation; disaggregates impacts by remoteness, a proxy for deforestation pressure; and compares strictly protected vs. multiple use {PAs} vs indigenous areas. Fire activity was overlaid on a 1 km map of tropical forest extent in 2000; land use change was inferred for any point experiencing one or more fires. Sampled points in pre-2000 {PAs} were matched with randomly selected never-protected points in the same country. Matching criteria included distance to road network, distance to major cities, elevation and slope, and rainfall. In Latin America and Asia, strict {PAs} substantially reduced fire incidence, but multi-use {PAs} were even more effective. In Latin America, where there is data on indigenous areas, these areas reduce forest fire incidence by 16 percentage points, over two and a half times as much as naïve (unmatched) comparison with unprotected areas would suggest. In Africa, more recently established strict {PAs} appear to be effective, but multi-use tropical forest protected areas yield few sample points, and their impacts are not robustly estimated. These results suggest that forest protection can contribute both to biodiversity conservation and {CO}2 mitigation goals, with particular relevance to the {REDD} agenda. Encouragingly, indigenous areas and multi-use protected areas can help to accomplish these goals, suggesting some compatibility between global environmental goals and support for local livelihoods.},
