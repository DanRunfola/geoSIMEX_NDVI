  Prais and Aitchison have shown that the common practice of grouping the
  individual observations in Engel curve analysis does not introduce a basis in
  the estimate of the regression coefficient, and that the classification of
  the individual households by income minimizes the increase in the variance of
  the estimate. The present paper provides an approximate numerical evaluation
  of the effects of such efficient grouping under the usual conditions of
  budget survey analysis. It is shown that in this case (i) the regression
  estimates based on individual observations and on weighted income class means
  are highly correlated; (ii) the variance of the estimates increases by a few
  per cent at most; and (iii) the correlation coefficient is vastly overstated
  by the grouped data.%

  For many species, determination of habitat selection is based on habitat-use
  data obtained through radiotelemetry. Recent papers pertaining to study
  techniques have largely ignored the effect of habitat-dependent bias in the
  performance of radiotelemetry systems. Such biases cannot be overcome by
  increasing radiotelemetry precision, excluding data, or increasing sample
  sizes, as the biases are centred around data that are missing or that contain
  habitat-dependent errors in location. The problem is best addressed at the
  data-analysis stage through the use of geographic information systems. We
  used Monte Carlo simulations to assess the effect of habitat-dependent bias
  in radiotelemetry studies on the assessment of habitat selection. We looked
  at the effects of habitat-patch size, level of telemetry signal inhibition,
  level of habitat co-occurrence, and selection pattern. We demonstrated that
  regarding use as the composition of habitat types within a circular area
  around each telemetry location can help to overcome the inaccurate assessment
  of habitat-selection patterns that biased data produce. The size of the
  circular area best able to overcome the bias is related to habitat patch size
  and to the level of association between two or more habitat types.
  Furthermore, we argue that the characteristics of habitat mosaics selected by
  animals can and should be studied in this way.; Â  Rettie and McLoughlin used

  environmental problems related to waste disposal, and air and water
  pollution. There is a rapidly growing need for technologies that will enable
  monitoring of the worldâs natural resources and urban assets, and managing
  exposure to natural and man-made risks. The Group on Earth Observation (GEO)
  calls for strengthening the cooperation and coordination among global
  observing systems and research programs. Global Urban Monitoring and
  Assessment through Earth Observation introduces this important international
  collaborative effort, reviews the current state of global urban remote
  sensing, and expands on future directions in the field. The book reviews the
  current state of global urban monitoring, assessment, modeling, and
  prediction through Earth observation and related technologies. It then
  introduces GEOâs important international collaborative effortâGlobal
  Urban Observation and Information Taskâand the current state of global
  urban remote sensing and future directions. It explores groundbreaking work
  in urban remote sensing and examines how it could contribute to the
  development of innovative concepts and techniques for sustainable urban
  development. Despite significant progress in recent years, there remain
  substantial gaps in ongoing national, regional, and global efforts to address
  environmental challenges. Edited by a well-known expert in the field of
  remote sensing, GIS, and other geospatial technologies, this book addresses
  the gaps in an effective and long-term manner, highlighting the importance of
  increased coordination and networking among major stakeholders and of working
  together with other key international mechanisms. Drawing on the expertise of
  pioneers in the field from across the globe, the book details emerging
  research in the theory, methods, and techniques of urban remote sensing that
  provide insight into how to solve the major issues of sustainable
  developmentâone of the most important issues facing society in the future.%

  Accurate maps of various key soil properties on fine spatial resolutions play
  an important role in precision modeling of agricultural systems. Recent
  development of alternatives to soil coring enables us to collect multiple
  sources of data, but data quality and spatial resolutions may differ greatly
  from one source to another. In this article, we use a multi-scale model for
  combining all data sources, despite varying resolutions and accuracies, to
  produce soil maps. We demonstrate that the method gives accurate results via
  computer simulations. Using the multi-scale method, we combine soil coring,
  penetrometer, and topographic data to map the depth-to-till on a 10-m
  resolution in an Arlington, Wisconsin field, and combine soil coring and soil
  electrical conductivity measurements to map field capacity on a 20-m
  resolution in a Waunakee, Wisconsin field. The proposed mapping technique has
  several advantages: (1) it is computationally fast and hence is well suited
  for landscape modeling-, (2) it provides a means to combine more than two
  sources of data; and (3) it provides a way to accommodate prior knowledge of
  spatial dependencies associated with various data sources. (C) 2003 Elsevier
